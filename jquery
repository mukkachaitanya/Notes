- All jQuery functions start with a $, usually referred to as a dollar sign operator, or simply as bling.

- jQuery often selects an HTML element with a selector, then does something to that element.
	eg. This adds a bounce to buttons upon document ready.
		$("button").addClass("animated bounce");
								 ^		  ^  (different classes)	
	$(class/elem/id).addClass("the required jQ act");


- target:nth-child(n) css selector allows you to select all the nth elements with the target class or element type.
